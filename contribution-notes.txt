We all met up together and worked out the concepts in general,
and with regards to the assignment specs.  We did pair programming
and developed alongside each other to implement (re)sharding.  We also
debugged issues from the last assignment (which only showed up in this assignment
due to running more replicas and thus more messages being transmitted) like
servers being overloaded from broadcasted heartbeat requests and the random
seed of the hash function causing infinite delivering and forwarding due to cycles.
